# About

The `AD_SYS` module is an old ad system module that acts as the settings for ads within SNU. Some important features are available, such as controlling what ads you see down to the very pixel, turning off ads entirely without any consequences for site usage, and also surveys for finding new ads. This module is near obsoletion, but its ideas will be merged into the new ad system module. This page may not be obsolete.
